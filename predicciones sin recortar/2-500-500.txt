PRED 1424: I don t know .

SENT 1425: Mr. Elster , suspecting all was not well with his wife s mental state ... took the preliminary precaution of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson lest any harm befall her . And you ve heard that Mr. Elster was prepared ... to take his wife to an institution where her mental health would ve been in the hands of qualified specialists . Mr. Ferguson , being an ex detective , would have seemed the proper choice for the role of watchdog and protector . As you have learned , it was an unfortunate choice .
PRED 1425: I m sorry .

SENT 1426: However , I think you il agree that no blame can be attached to the husband .
PRED 1426: I m sorry .

SENT 1427: Or you may believe that , having once again allowed someone to die ... he could not face the tragic result of his own weakness and ran away . That has nothing to do with your verdict .
PRED 1427: We have no choice .

SENT 1428: It is a matter between him and his own conscience .
PRED 1428: I am not a murderer .

SENT 1429: Scottie , let s go .
PRED 1429: Let s go .

SENT 1430: Mind if I speak to him for a minute ?

SENT 1432: I m getting out , Scottie , for good .
PRED 1432: I m sorry .

SENT 1433: You and I know who killed Madeleine .
PRED 1433: You know what ?

SENT 1434: Come on , Scottie .
PRED 1434: Come on .

SENT 1435: It shuts off automatically .
PRED 1435: I m sorry .

SENT 1436: Johnny , please try .
PRED 1436: I m sorry .

SENT 1437: You don t even know I m here , do you ?
PRED 1437: No .

PRED 1470: My pleasure .

SENT 1471: He dressed me like her .
PRED 1471: What ?

SENT 1472: He was quite safe because she lived in the country and rarely came to town .
PRED 1472: I m sorry .

SENT 1473: I fell in love .
PRED 1473: I m sorry .

SENT 1474: That wasn t part of the plan .

PRED 4075: Yes .

SENT 4076: It was like nothing I d ever seen before .
PRED 4076: You know , I was just trying to figure out what s going on .

SENT 4077: At that moment I observed great changes in the ocean .
PRED 4077: It was the only way to get to the surface .

SENT 4078: The water became still , and the surface looked transparent .
PRED 4078: And the water was broken .

SENT 4079: I was being drawn to the fog bank ,
PRED 4079: but I had to go to the bathroom .

SENT 4080: so I had to struggle against this force for some time .
PRED 4080: You know what ?

SENT 4081: And all these trees and plants , did they have leaves ?
PRED 4081: Yes .

SENT 4082: Those bushes , <unk> ?

PRED 4094: I m sorry .

SENT 4095: there isn t very much more .
PRED 4095: I don t know .

SENT 4096: Burton s statements would appear to be the expression of a <unk> complex ,
PRED 4096: and the fact of the matter is ,

SENT 4097: who believes that the information
PRED 4097: is the most important thing .

SENT 4098: supplied by Burton could be true
PRED 4098: and made a living out of life .

SENT 4099: Every explorer may well envy this pilot ,
PRED 4099: he is a member of the United States of America .

SENT 4100: his presence of mind , his talents of observation .
PRED 4100: In fact ,

SENT 4101: All we know about Solaris
PRED 4101: is that it s true

SENT 4102: reminds me of a mountain of separate facts
PRED 4102: that I ve never seen before .

SENT 4103: we limit our concept of the infinity of man s knowledge .
PRED 4103: But if you do , you will be able to do it .

SENT 4104: And if our movement is not forward , do we not risk moving backward ?
PRED 4104: It is not a problem .

SENT 4105: to mistake a swinging bush for a living creature .
PRED 4105: I m sorry .

SENT 4106: To say nothing of a strange planet !
PRED 4106: I don t know .

SENT 4107: to laugh whenever Burton s report is mentioned .
PRED 4107: I m sorry .

SENT 4108: We ve known you a long time , but still I know so little about you .

PRED 8770: There s no point .

SENT 8771: But I do understand the reason for it to work .

PRED 8784: Don t worry .

SENT 8785: For this .

PRED 8793: No .

SENT 8794: It s tough to get more obvious than that .
PRED 8794: You know what ?

SENT 8795: Bad news is there s no way you can really know if I m here to help you or not . So it s really up to you .
PRED 8795: It s just that you re not .

SENT 8796: Just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I m going to tell you or reject it . Candy ?
PRED 8796: Yeah .

SENT 8797: I thought you d have figured that out by now .
PRED 8797: That s why I m here .

SENT 8798: Why are you here ?
PRED 8798: I don t know .

SENT 8799: Are there other programs like you ?
PRED 8799: No .

SENT 8800: Well , not like me , but Look .
PRED 8800: I don t know .

SENT 8801: But the other ones Well , you hear about them all the time .
PRED 8801: They don t know what they re talking about .

SENT 8802: I ve never heard of them .
PRED 8802: I don t know .

SENT 8803: Happens all the time .
PRED 8803: That s right .

SENT 8804: And when it does , a program can either choose to hide here or return to the source . The machine mainframe .
PRED 8804: I don t know .

SENT 8805: Do you see her die ?
PRED 8805: No .

SENT 8806: No .
PRED 8806: No .

SENT 8807: Now you have to understand it .
PRED 8807: I m sorry .

SENT 8808: No .
PRED 8808: No .

SENT 8809: What happens if I fail ?
PRED 8809: I don t know .

SENT 8810: Then Zion will fall .
PRED 8810: I il go .

SENT 8811: And he won t let him go willingly .
PRED 8811: I m sorry .

SENT 8812: What does he want ?
PRED 8812: I don t know .

SENT 8813: But for what it s worth you ve made a believer out of me . Good luck , kiddo .
PRED 8813: Thanks .

SENT 8814: Mr. Anderson .
PRED 8814: Yes .

SENT 8815: No .
PRED 8815: No .

SENT 8816: Then you re aware of it .
PRED 8816: I know .

SENT 8817: I watched you die .
PRED 8817: I m sorry .

SENT 8818: With a certain satisfaction , I might add .
PRED 8818: I don t know .

SENT 8819: A new man , so to speak .
PRED 8819: I don t know .

SENT 8820: Like you , apparently free .
PRED 8820: What ?

SENT 8821: Purpose that connects us .
PRED 8821: It is .

SENT 8822: Purpose that pulls us .
PRED 8822: Yes , it is .

PRED 8824: I don t know .

SENT 8825: Me too .
PRED 8825: Yeah .

SENT 8826: More .
PRED 8826: More .

SENT 8827: A lot more .
PRED 8827: I m sorry .

SENT 8828: How is that possible ?
PRED 8828: I don t know .

SENT 8829: The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system .
PRED 8829: These are the coordinates .

SENT 8830: But I believe they will intersect certain <unk> to control them .
PRED 8830: I m sure they will .

SENT 8831: Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One .
PRED 8831: We will not be able to do that .

SENT 8832: I wish that were possible , councillor , but I do not believe our defense can suffer the loss of another ship . It will , commander , if it must .
PRED 8832: I will not .

SENT 8833: <unk> is not a requisite of cooperation .
PRED 8833: He s a requisite .

SENT 9943: The machines are digging tunnels to avoid our defense system .
PRED 9943: They re not responding .

SENT 9944: But I believe that they go to certain <unk> main lines , to be able to control them .
PRED 9944: I think it is .

SENT 9945: He she has our approval to prepare our defense for anyone and all the necessary means .
PRED 9945: I will not allow it .

SENT 9946: Thank you <unk> .
PRED 9946: Thank you .

SENT 10044: Why ?
PRED 10044: Why ?

SENT 10045: Nobody said it was gonna be .
PRED 10045: I know .

SENT 10046: You think Cas thinks it s fair that I m here and Dozer s not ?
PRED 10046: I don t know .

SENT 10047: Because of what he s told me .
PRED 10047: I don t know .

SENT 10048: He said that this is it , that it will be over soon .

SENT 10050: Tonight , let us honor these men and women .
PRED 10050: I want you to join us .

SENT 10051: But if we are to be prepared for it , we must first shed our fear of it .
PRED 10051: I will not be able to do it .

SENT 10052: I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid .
PRED 10052: No !

SENT 10053: And after a century of war , I remember that which matters most

SENT 10065: I hate sleeping .
PRED 10065: I m sorry .

SENT 10066: I never sleep more than a few hours .

SENT 10067: Have you ever been to the engineering level ?
PRED 10067: Yes .

SENT 10068: I love to walk there at night .
PRED 10068: I love you .

SENT 10069: Nobody cares how it works as long as it works .
PRED 10069: I don t know .

SENT 10070: I like it down here .
PRED 10070: I don t know .

SENT 10071: How could they ?
PRED 10071: What ?

SENT 10072: The idea is pure nonsense ... but it does make one wonder just what is control ? If we wanted , we could shut these machines down .
PRED 10072: We can t do that .

SENT 10073: Is that your point , councillor ?
PRED 10073: No .

SENT 10074: No .
PRED 10074: No .

SENT 10075: There is so much in this world that I do not understand . See that machine ?
PRED 10075: It is a ? .

SENT 10076: It has something to do with recycling our water supply .
PRED 10076: I have no idea .

SENT 10077: ls he here ?

SENT 10086: I had to give something to Neo .
PRED 10086: I didn t know .

SENT 10087: Am I still in charge of our defense system ?
PRED 10087: No .

SENT 10088: Of course .
PRED 10088: I m sorry .

SENT 10089: You seek the Oracle .
PRED 10089: The path of the Ring .

SENT 10090: Who are you ?
PRED 10090: Who are you ?

SENT 10091: I had to be sure .
PRED 10091: I m sorry .

SENT 10098: Why don t you come and have a sit this time .
PRED 10098: I m sorry .

SENT 10099: If I had to guess , I d say you re a program from the machine world .
PRED 10099: I don t know .

SENT 10100: So is he .
PRED 10100: He s a good man .

SENT 10101: Do you already know if I il take it ?
PRED 10101: No .

SENT 10102: Wouldn t be much of an oracle if I didn t .
PRED 10102: That s not true .

SENT 10103: Same reason .
PRED 10103: I m sorry .

SENT 10104: I love candy .
PRED 10104: I love you .

SENT 10105: Look .
PRED 10105: I m sorry .

SENT 10107: Well , you hear about them all the time .
PRED 10107: You know what ?

SENT 10108: I ve never heard of them .
PRED 10108: I don t know .

SENT 10109: Happens all the time .
PRED 10109: That s right .

SENT 10110: And when it does , a program can either choose to hide here or return to the source . The machine mainframe .
PRED 10110: I don t know .

SENT 10111: Do you see her die ?
PRED 10111: No .

SENT 10112: No .
PRED 10112: No .

SENT 10113: Now you have to understand it .
PRED 10113: I m sorry .

SENT 10114: No .
PRED 10114: No .

SENT 10115: What happens if I fail ?
PRED 10115: I don t know .

SENT 10116: Then Zion will fall .
PRED 10116: I il go .

SENT 10117: And he won t let him go willingly .
PRED 10117: I m sorry .

SENT 10118: What does he want ?
PRED 10118: I don t know .

SENT 10119: But for what it s worth you ve made a believer out of me . Good luck , kiddo .
PRED 10119: Thanks .

SENT 10120: Mr. Anderson .
PRED 10120: Yes .

SENT 10121: No .
PRED 10121: No .

SENT 10122: Then you re aware of it .
PRED 10122: I know .

SENT 10123: I watched you die .
PRED 10123: I m sorry .

SENT 10124: With a certain satisfaction , I might add .
PRED 10124: I don t know .

SENT 10125: A new man , so to speak .
PRED 10125: I don t know .

SENT 10126: Like you , apparently free .
PRED 10126: What ?

SENT 10127: Purpose that connects us .
PRED 10127: It is .

SENT 10128: Purpose that pulls us .
PRED 10128: Yes , it is .

SENT 10129: Purpose .

PRED 10131: Yeah .

SENT 10132: More .
PRED 10132: More .

SENT 10133: A lot more .
PRED 10133: I m sorry .

SENT 10134: How is that possible ?
PRED 10134: I don t know .

SENT 10135: The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system .
PRED 10135: These are the coordinates .

SENT 10136: But I believe they will intersect certain <unk> to control them .
PRED 10136: I m sure they will .

SENT 10137: Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One .
PRED 10137: We will not be able to do that .

SENT 10138: I wish that were possible , councillor , but I do not believe our defense can suffer the loss of another ship . It will , commander , if it must .
PRED 10138: I will not .

SENT 10139: <unk> is not a requisite of cooperation .
PRED 10139: He s a requisite .

SENT 10140: If you are asking me to order two of my captains
PRED 10140: you il be able to take care of yourself .

SENT 10141: You understand the situation , Captain Soren ?
PRED 10141: Yes .

SENT 10142: Yes , ma am .
PRED 10142: Thank you .

SENT 10143: Be hard for any man to risk his life especially if he doesn t understand the reason . Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor s call .
PRED 10143: Thank you .

SENT 10144: What ?
PRED 10144: What ?

SENT 10145: Because some things never change , Jason and some things do . What can you see , Neo ?
PRED 10145: What can I do ?

SENT 10146: It s strange .
PRED 10146: I don t know .

SENT 10147: Here we go .
PRED 10147: Come on .

SENT 10148: Yes .
PRED 10148: Yes .

SENT 10149: Right ?
PRED 10149: Yeah .

SENT 10150: And the legendary Morpheus .
PRED 10150: The leader of the United States .

SENT 10151: Something to eat ?
PRED 10151: No .

SENT 10152: Drink ?
PRED 10152: No .

PRED 10156: Because you re not .

SENT 10157: But this is not a reason , this is not a why .
PRED 10157: I don t know .

SENT 10158: The Keymaker himself , his very nature , is a means , it is not an end .
PRED 10158: It is a matter of fact .

SENT 10159: You see , there is only one constant one universal . It is the only real truth .
PRED 10159: The truth .

SENT 10160: <unk> .
PRED 10160: <unk> .

SENT 10161: My God , just look at her affecting everyone around her . So obvious , so bourgeois , so boring .
PRED 10161: Thank you .

SENT 10162: But wait .
PRED 10162: Wait .

SENT 10163: No .
PRED 10163: No .

SENT 10164: What is it then ?
PRED 10164: I don t know .

SENT 10165: We are forever slaves to it .
PRED 10165: We have to go .

SENT 10166: Our only hope , our only peace , is to understand it , to understand the why .
PRED 10166: I don t know .

SENT 10167: Her time is almost up .
PRED 10167: She s not here .

SENT 10168: Now I have some real business to do , so I will say adieu and goodbye .
PRED 10168: I m sorry .

SENT 10169: We are all victims of <unk> .
PRED 10169: We are not . .

SENT 10170: I drank too much wine , I must take a piss .
PRED 10170: I m sorry .

SENT 10171: Maybe we did something wrong .
PRED 10171: No .

SENT 10172: Or didn t do something .

PRED 10173: That s it .

PRED 10176: I love you .

SENT 10177: I want to sample it .
PRED 10177: What s the matter ?

SENT 10178: That s all .
PRED 10178: That s it .

SENT 10179: If I don t deliver you to the Keymaker , she can kill me .
PRED 10179: What do you mean ?

SENT 10180: All right .
PRED 10180: All right .

SENT 10181: Yes .
PRED 10181: Yes .

PRED 10184: I m sorry .

SENT 10185: How many people keep silver bullets in their gun ?
PRED 10185: What ?

SENT 10186: You can either run and tell my husband what I have done or you can stay there and die . He s in the ladies room !
PRED 10186: He s coming !

SENT 10187: My God , Persephone , how could you do this ?
