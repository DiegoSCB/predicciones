SENT 1425: Mr. Elster , suspecting all was not well with his wife s mental state ... took the preliminary precaution of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson lest any harm befall her . And you ve heard that Mr. Elster was prepared ... to take his wife to an institution where her mental health would ve been in the hands of qualified specialists . Mr. Ferguson , being an ex detective , would have seemed the proper choice for the role of watchdog and protector . As you have learned , it was an unfortunate choice .
PRED 1425: I m sorry .

SENT 1426: However , I think you il agree that no blame can be attached to the husband .
PRED 1426: I don t know .

SENT 1427: Or you may believe that , having once again allowed someone to die ... he could not face the tragic result of his own weakness and ran away . That has nothing to do with your verdict .
PRED 1427: It s not your fault .

SENT 1428: It is a matter between him and his own conscience .
PRED 1428: It is a matter of time .

SENT 1429: Scottie , let s go .

SENT 1433: You and I know who killed Madeleine .
PRED 1433: I m sorry .

SENT 1434: Come on , Scottie .
PRED 1434: Come on .

SENT 1435: It shuts off automatically .

SENT 1470: This is the moment that I dreaded and hoped for wondering what I would say and do if I ever saw you again . I wanted so to see you again , just once .
PRED 1470: I m sorry .

SENT 1471: He dressed me like her .
PRED 1471: I m sorry .

SENT 1472: He was quite safe because she lived in the country and rarely came to town .
PRED 1472: He was a good man .

SENT 1473: I fell in love .
