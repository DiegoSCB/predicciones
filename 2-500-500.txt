PRED 19885:  They re not responding .

SENT 19887:  But I believe that they go to certain <unk> main lines , to be able to control them .
PRED 19887:  I think it is .

PRED 34061:  Of course , we have the right to remain silent .

SENT 34073:  It s most probably ... a pathetically mechanical attempt to <unk> the emotional tension of the next game sequence . No use fighting it .
PRED 34073:  It s not a problem .

SENT 34081:  You il pop right out of the game if there s a problem .

SENT 34111:  I mean , all games can be paused , right ?
PRED 34111:  It does .

SENT 34115:  I actually think there s an element of psychosis involved here . This is a great sign .
PRED 34115:  It s a . .

SENT 34123:  And you you re beginning to feel like a game character . Definitely not .
PRED 34123:  You know what ?

SENT 34127:  Mutant reptiles and <unk> provide new and previously <unk> taste sensations . Shall I clear all this away ?

PRED 34169:  What ?

SENT 34171:  But now you re gonna put a stop to him .
PRED 34171:  That s what I m talking about .

SENT 34181:  That s a diseased pod .

PRED 34219:  No , no .

SENT 34221:  It uses the <unk> pickups for power .
PRED 34221:  This is the main system .

SENT 34223:  It should cleanse all your <unk> channels of infection .
PRED 34223:  I have to go .

SENT 34225:  Were you really saying that <unk> is an agent for Oh , God ! Pikul my pod s dying . I can t help it .
PRED 34225:  I can t .

SENT 34227:  There s nothing l can do for it . The uprising has begun !
PRED 34227:  The Son .

SENT 34231:  I can t let my game die !
PRED 34231:  I can t do that .

SENT 38031:  Get out , all of you !
PRED 38031:  Get out !

SENT 38033:  Now what , Piter ?
PRED 38033:  What is it ?

SENT 38035:  Advancing our timetable would seem appropriate at this point .
PRED 38035:  We re not going to let that happen .
